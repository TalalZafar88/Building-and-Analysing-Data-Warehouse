# Building-and-Analysing-Data-Warehouse
The aim of the project was to design, implement, and analyze a Data Warehouse (DW) prototype so that we make analysis of shopping behavior, optimize selling techniques etc. We had to build the warehouse with the data source which we were given. For this we implemented a real time ETL (Extraction, Transformation, and Loading) because the warehouse schema is different from database. We implemented the **Mesh Join** algorithm for integrating the transactional data with master data before loading into warehouse. After building the warehouse I analyzed the DW by applying OLAP queries.
